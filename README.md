## About Our Project 
An  Android application that allows the user to exchange multiple options like, products, services and so on. 
The user will create his own page where he would be able to list his skills, products and whatever service he is able to provide and advertise in exchange for other services or offers from another users. 

This app is created in the attempt of dealing with trading and exchanging items and experiences in a different approach. People can come together and interact in way that is detached from the material world, knowledge and skills will be passed on from one person to another. 

The user would be able to add posts of services he wants to provide, he can specify what he wants in return or leave it open for offers from other users or he would have the option to search for a specific request. Once the user finds what he is looking for he can contact the user that is providing it.

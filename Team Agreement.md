# Cooperation Plan


## Key strengths   

Each member of our team has a unique and strong personality which is a huge benefit for this project, each possesses a key strength that differs from one another. Some have a great background in coding and programming using Java and other languages and some are grate with front end and data structure and some have strong communication and are able to express themselves clearly. 
Taking all these different skills and combining them together will ensure that we cover all the areas and aspects that our project will face. 

## Competencies
whatever one member has and the other doesnâ€™t, we wish to get out of this project with a shared skills and point of views. 
There are areas that we need to work on more than the others like certain java functionality, deployment of our project on places like Heroku, java web-socket, AWS and so on. 

## Day-to-Day work
All the team members will follow the wire-frame designed for this project. 
We would have scheduled meeting every day to discuss the progress that is made, and a recap for all the work done previously and is about to be done in the future. 
Work would be divided in a way that allows all the team member to work and engage with all the different functionality and codes in our project 
At the end of each day the members will refer to each other to make sure that they are on the same bored. 



# Conflict Plan 

## resolving conflicts
If a conflict was ever raised, the steps of handling that conflict would be: 
-	Report to the team leader
-	 Describe the conflict 
-	Discus the problem at hand and get to the root of that problem to try and solve it. 
-	Work on ways to overcome it and move pass it.
-	Provide a safe environment where all team members can openly share their concerns. 
-	If the conflict is not solved report back to the project supervisor (Lead teacher). 


It is important that all the team members to be on the same page. Working together in professional way, enduring all the pressure and whatever obstacles that might be in the way. And to do that we need having different levels and different strength can rise a challenge for us when building this web-site, but what we can do is make sure that everyone has a full understanding of what we are doing, and utilize all the strengths that we have to overcome whatever weaknesses we have. 

Any members that fail to commit to the rules of building this project will have to be dealt with accordingly: 
-	He/she would be reported to the team leader where he would be asked to alter his/her behaver and follow the rules 
-	If the problem continues to resume, the team member would be reported to the lead
